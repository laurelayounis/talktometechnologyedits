# âœ¨ Features

- Communication board with accessible colors and actions
- Play sound and provide feedback
- Color scheme based on Fitzgerald key

## Color Scheme

This communication board uses the Fitzgerald Key Groups parts of speech. The key assigns colors to different parts of speech to make it easier to find the right kind of word.

| Color  | Description  |
|--------|--------------|
| Blue   | adjectives   |
| Green  | verbs        |
| Yellow | pronouns     |
| Orange | nouns        |
| White  | conjunctions |
| Pink   | questions    |
| Brown  | adverbs      |
| Red    | important function words, negation, emergency words |

## Setup

The repository uses static HTML/JavaScript files which can be cloned and served by a webserver.

The following sections describe different environments to get started.

### Gitpod Environment

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/XollabOS/talktometechnology)

### Local Environment

Clone this repository and run the static files with a webserver (e.g. Nginx/Apache, or different HTTP servers).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/XollabOS/talktometechnology && cd talktometechnology
```

Python provides a small HTTP server for development, including live preview of changes.

Install Python using your preferred package manager, for example Homebrew on macOS:

```
$ brew install python3
```

Run the `http.server` module and set the listening port to `3000`.

```
$ python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

> **Note**
>
> There are alternative HTTP server implementations in NodeJS, PHP, etc. in case you do not want to use Python.

### Container Environment

> **Note**
>
> This environment uses containers and may require advanced knowledge in case of failure.

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or available [alternatives on macOS](https://dnsmichi.at/2022/03/15/docker-desktop-alternatives-macos-podman-nerdctl-rancher-desktop/), Windows or Linux.

Clone this repository to run a HTTP container image serving the content.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/XollabOS/talktometechnology && cd talktometechnology
```

Run the `nginx:latest` container image, listen on port 3000 and mount the current directory into the Nginx default webserver root directory `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

```
docker run -ti --rm -d -p 3000:80 --name ttmt -v `pwd`:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can modify the source code and preview the changes live in your browser.

Cleanup/delete commands:

```
$ docker ps
$ docker stop ttmt
```
